This repository contains my hands-on practice while working through Python Crash Course Vol. 2
The goal isn’t just to read the book, but to actually build things and solidify concepts through projects.
The repo is organized around three main pillars:
- Chapter practice problems
- Mini projects after every chapter
- Larger projects after every 5 chapters
Everything here is written by me while learning, refactoring, and improving my Python skills.
